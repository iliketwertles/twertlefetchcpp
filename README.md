# twertlefetchcpp
just like twertlefetch but in c++

## Compatibility
Linux/Unix-like only, no windows support expected 

The only distro supported OOTB is gentoo with emerge, other package managers can be added via a PR or a personal fork

## Features
Few and Far between, but adding -f after the command shows the fetch with a fumo instead of tux

## Building
simple, `g++ main.cpp` inside of the cloned repo

## Contributions
Feel free to fork, or PR, does not bother me  
PR's will be looked at
